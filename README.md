# 📧 Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning

This project uses **Logistic Regression** and **TF-IDF Vectorization** to classify emails as **spam** or **not spam (ham)**. It is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook using the scikit-learn and pandas libraries.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Spam detection is a classic machine learning problem where we classify messages based on their content. This notebook demonstrates:

- Reading and processing a CSV dataset (`mail_data.csv`)
- Cleaning and preparing the text data
- Converting text into numerical features using `TfidfVectorizer`
- Splitting data into training and testing sets
- Training a **Logistic Regression model**
- Evaluating the model's accuracy
- Predicting custom email texts
